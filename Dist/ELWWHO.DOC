 WHAT IS WHO'S ON?

 Who's On is a simple who's online global command module that allows the
 SysOp to define up to 5 strings to filter out from the standard Who's On
 listing. This could be to eliminate certain high-use games (MajorMUD) from
 the general user listing. The module also allows users to replace the 
 filters with a string of their choosing, or augment the system filter with
 a string of their choosing. There are up to 4 listing styles to customize! 
 
 INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
  
 Simply unzip the archive to your BBS server directory. If you'd like
 the module to work as a menu item, you can add it to your menu. But
 it should work just fine as a global-only product.
 
 Configure the global character, whether you want to see a listing at
 logon (and which one), and the up to 5 filter strings in LEVEL4.
 
 Customize the 4 listing formats and other text in LEVEL6.
 
 MODULE HISTORY
 
 Who's On was written by Rick Hadsall of Elwynor Technologies in 
 January and February 2025 in response to a request from Brian Morgan
 of The Penalty Box BBS, who wanted a Who's On listing that filtered out
 certain modules due to significant users of MUD games. Rick wrote it
 to work with WG2, WG32, and BBSV10 and released it as open source.
